        <h3>Counter-Strike presents a big challenge for every newcomer. Whether it's gun handling, the use of utilities or map knowledge: CS2 offers a great deal of tactical depth and new players have to get to grips with it bit by bit.</h3>
        <h1>REDUCE MOUSE SENSITIVITY AND CROSSHAIR PLACEMENT</h1>
        <h3>CS2 is all about precision. The game's complex gunplay requires good aiming and good mouse control. Reduce the sensitivity of your mouse to have better control, especially at longer distances. It's worth practising a few rounds on the deathmatch server to find the perfect scythe. Many players also take inspiration from the settings of pros such as s1mple or ZywOo.</h3>
        <h3>Good crosshair placement also makes aiming a lot easier – for example, never look at the ground when running. Try to anticipate where an opponent might be. Then bring your crosshair into the right position before the peak. The less hand movement required, the quicker and more precise your hits will be.</h3>
        <h1>KEEP IT QUIET</h1>
        <h3>This is not a game for tap dancers! If you're too loud in Counter-Strike, you give your opponent a lot of information about your position. So try to avoid making any unnecessary noise. Use Shift to sneak as often as you can without losing time. In CS2, you now also have an indicator on the minimap that shows you the audible range of your steps.</h3>
        <h3>Also optimise your starting position. Make sure to deactivate possible sources of interference such as music or background programmes before starting the game so as not to mask the game sound. A headset is also much more reliable for precise hearing than a loudspeaker.</h3>
        <h1>DON'T BE AGGRESSIVE OR TOO PASSIVE</h1>
        <h3>Many newcomers often play too aggressively at the beginning. Counter-Strike is a game of patience in many situations, where a wait-and-see approach is often rewarded. Always pay attention to the timing of your pushes, for example when the opponent could rotate. Also, a constantly aggressive style of play quickly becomes predictable.</h3>
        <h3>The same applies to the other side of the coin. If you act too passively, you could miss good opportunies for pushes. Your mates can also suffer from a hesitant approach if your help comes too late as a result. Be brave and push at a favourable moment to surprise your opponents.</h3>
        <h1>MONEY MANAGEMENT AND TEAM COORDINATION</h1>
        <h3>The unusual money and purchase system often overwhelms CS newcomers. When should I buy and when should I save? The most important rule is: don't always spend everything! In CS, "eco rounds" are an important tactical component. If you save your money for one round, you can fully equip yourself in the next round.</h3>
        <h3>This also includes making arrangements with your mates. A team should always coordinate their purchases in order to maximise their chances of winning a round. Both the buy rounds and the eco rounds should be coordinated and synchronised. If there is no verbal communication, you can use your mates' money on the scoreboard as a guide.</h3>
        <h1>RUN AND GUN IS NOT AN OPTION</h1>
        <h3>An often hard lesson for newcomers, but gunplay in Counter-Strike is difficult. Anyone picking up the AK for the first time in the iconic FPS will quickly despair at the handling. One of the most important rules when handling assault rifles: stand still to hit!</h3>
        <h3>While the 'run and gun' principle is part of the gameplay in many other titles, in CS2 you should only resort to it with a few SMGs and a few pistols. The assault rifles in particular require not only good aim, but also precise movement. Take some time on deathmatch servers to familiarise yourself with the difficult weapon handling and the principle of counterstrafing.</h3>
        <h1>KNOW YOUR MAPS</h1>
        <h3>Communication is a key part of Counter-Strike. One of the most important elements is information about the positions of opponents. Problem: each map has its own names for certain positions and these can cause confusion at the beginning. You should therefore never play a map in matchmaking without first familiarising yourself with the most important call-outs.</h3>
        <h3>Before playing your first official on an unfamiliar map, it's worth taking a look online. You will find layouts with all positions and their names for all maps. While announcements such as "CT-Spawn" or "A-Lang" can be clear, newcomers are more likely to scratch their heads at calls such as "Jungle" or "Undergrowth" on Mirage.</h3>
        <h3>As if that wasn't enough, some callouts no longer make sense. Many positions got their names from the first map versions many years ago. For example, the barrels on Inferno at the top of the banana are still labelled "Car", even though there hasn't been a car there for a long time.</h3>
