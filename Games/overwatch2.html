        <h3>It’s easy to enjoy Overwatch as just another multiplayer shooter; but much of the appeal of Overwatch lies in poking around at its edges – experimenting with the various different characters and their abilities, and discovering fascinating new mechanics.</h3>
        <h1>HEALTH, ARMOUR & SHIELDS</h1>
        <h3>Understanding how different types of hit points in Overwatch work will help give you a better grasp of your survivability in a fight. Outside of pickups and the aid of certain support classes, health (white on your HP bar) and armour (yellow) do not regenerate.</h3>
        <h3>Shields (blue), however, do regenerate. Prime examples of this include Reinhardt’s Barrier Field and Zarya’s Particle Barrier. Shield abilities like Symmetra’s Photon Shield, which persist on an ally until death, regenerate as well after 3 seconds of no damage. So remember that the next time you receive one from Symmetra. Additionally, shields can absorb any one attack greater than its value, such as Junkrat’s RIP-Tire or D.Va’s Self-Destruct, before disappearing.</h3>
        <h3>Armour, on the other hand, reduces the damage of each hit by 5. This makes high-armour heroes like D.Va useful up against low-damage weapons such as Tracer’s Pulse Pistols or Soldier 76’s Heavy Pulse Rifle, where they do close to no damage after the reduction.</h3>

        <h1>PAYLOAD CAN HEAL YOU</h1>
        <h3>If you are on the offense team on a payload map, it pays to remember that the payload can also heal you. So if you’re low on health and you’re having trouble finding a healer or a health pack close by, try sticking close to the payload instead to regain your health. Plus, you’ll be contributing to the objective by pushing the payload forward.</h3>
        <h1>ESCORTING THE PAYLOAD</h1>
        <h3>Speaking of pushing the payload forward, you don’t need a full team to escort the payload. Three players are all it takes to move the payload at its top speed. This allows the other players in the team to attack and defend the flanks, or provide cover fire from a safe distance.</h3>
        <h1>THERE'S MELEE</h1>
        <h3>Players often forget that all heroes have a short, 30-damage melee attack they can do, whether it’s a punch or a pistol-whip. It doesn’t have a lot of range, but if you’re in close quarters and the enemy doesn’t have a lot of health left, it might be more effective to whip out your melee instead of trying to hit with your regular attack.</h3>
        <h3>You can also do an animation cancel with the melee. Whenever you’re reloading, the animation for the reload goes on for just a tiny bit longer after the weapon actually reloads. You can cancel that animation into a melee attack, which is helpful when enemies are trying to corner you while you’re reloading.</h3>
        <h1>ADJUST CHARACTER-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</h1>
        <h3>Not immediately apparent in the options menu is the ability to change character-specific control preferences. In here you can tweak settings like having Genji, Hanzo, and Junkrat’s RIP-Tire auto-climb walls (for that extra mobility), or adjusting the zoom sensitivity on Widowmaker’s scope.</h3>
        <h1>TURRENT AND TRAPS AND HEALTH PACKS</h1>
        <h3>You can place hazards like Torbjorn’s turret or Junkrat’s steel trap on top of health packs. Not only does this net you some easy kills from low-health enemies seeking relief; but the turrets and traps also use up the health packs if they get damaged, denying it to the enemy if they try to destroy the turret/trap.</h3>
        <h1>MAKE USE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h1>
        <h3>You don’t always have to rely on simple shooting and hacking to kill enemies. You can also attach things like Symmetra’s sentry turret or Junkrat’s steel trap on props like a basketball for some creative kills.</h3>
        <h3>Alternatively, pay attention to maps and where you might fall to your death. You can push enemies over the edge with attacks like Lucio’s Soundwave or Roadhog’s ultimate ability. Or better yet, shoot Zarya’s Graviton Surge ultimate ability over a pit and watch as it pulls enemies in to certain doom.</h3>
