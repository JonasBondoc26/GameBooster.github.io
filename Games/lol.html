        <h3>League of Legends is one of those games where you never stop improving. There’s always a part of your game you can refine or a tiny interaction between champions you didn't know about before.</h3>
        <h1>DEDICATE YOURSELF TO ONE ROLE</h1>
        <h3>Yes, it's important to have knowledge of all roles, but everyone will always have a preference. If you haven't already, choose a preferred role as your 'main' and your results in ranked will improve drastically.</h3>
        <h3>By focusing on one role, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of its intricacies much more quickly. You’ll know what champions you’re most comfortable on, their good and bad match-ups, and how you can best to help your team.</h3>
        <h1>PERFECT YOUR CHAMPION POOL</h1>
        <h3>Once you've chosen your role, it’s time to find your favourite champions. Don't be a meta slave who only plays whatever has the highest win rate each week, find champions that you actually enjoy playing and perform well with.</h3>
        <h3>If you’re having fun, not only will you be more invested in improving, but you'll also probably play more games – which will also help your development.</h3>
        <h3>Do make sure you’re comfortable on different types of champions as well, though. During every draft phase you should look at your team-mates’ and opponents’ picks, and then decide what your team needs.</h3>
        <h3>Being a big beefy tank who absorbs damage isn't the most glorious job, but in doing so you'll be much more likely to win fights if your team already has a lot of damage. You may like playing assassins mid, but if you already have an AD top-laner and jungler, then pick an AP champion to diversify your team’s damage. Otherwise, your opponents will just stack armour and win the late game.</h3>
        <h1>ALWAYS FOCUS ON OBJECTIVES</h1>
        <h3>It’s the hardest lesson to learn in LoL and we’re all guilty of it, but kills aren’t everything. Random kills will only get you a tiny bit of gold. When you get kills and how you react afterwards is much more important. Objectives really are where LoL games are won or lost, so use your bloodlust for good.</h3>
        <h3>Everything you do should be with objectives in mind. Baron or Dragon spawning in 30 seconds? Take down the opposing jungler and the monster is practically yours. If you want to destroy a tower so you can leave your lane and group with your team, get some help with your jungler for a gank followed up by a siege.</h3>
        <h3>A bonus tip: if the enemy team is getting a lot of dragons, try to contest them on their third Drake rather than the fourth. That way, if you don't win the fight, at least the game isn't lost. You’ll have another chance to regroup and try to prevent the Dragon Soul.</h3>
        <h3>Rotations are when you group up with team-mates and push your advantage by moving from lane-to-lane. Once your siege wave runs out at the enemy tower, group up and move down to another lane together, and try to push for that tower instead. Then, by pushing big waves towards the opposing base, you can peel back to Baron, knowing your opponents will either arrive late or miss out on loads of gold if they ignore said minions.</h3>
        <h1>HOW TO GET BETTER AT FARMING</h1>
        <h3>Let's set expectations. If you watch pro LoL matches you'll notice that players regularly reach 10 CS a minute, but that just isn’t realistic for 90 percent of players and that's OK.</h3>
        <h3>There's a lot of factors that go into getting good farm. Practicing last hitting in the practice tool is a great place to start, but it's much harder once you also have to trade with a lane opponent.</h3>
        <h3>So, in the early game it's all about the match-up. If your opponent is stronger early, then stay safe and maybe use more abilities to farm from afar. Dying will cost you a lot of CS, so staying alive, letting your opponents push and setting up your jungler for a gank is your best bet.</h3>
        <h3>Otherwise, try to pressure your opponent when they try to farm. If they're last hitting with autos, watch your own minions' health and once they're low you can step forward and hit your opponent for free, knowing that they're locked into their auto animation and can't trade back.</h3>
        <h3>In the mid-to-late game, make sure you're still always farming. You should never be doing nothing. Instead of pointlessly grouping mid, find a side lane where the wave is pushing into your half of the map and go collect it on your own, as long as you're safe to do so. Other than when needing to set up for epic monsters or trying to siege, you should always be farming waves or jungle camps to keep levelling up.</h3>
        <h3>Just make sure you don't push too far and become vulnerable to a gank. Walk where you have vision and team-mates nearby. If you cross into the opponent's half without deep wards, you're going to get killed and miss out on more CS than you gained in the first place. And also make sure you communicate with your team and don't miss a big fight.</h3>
        <h1>BECOME A LANING PHASE MONSTER</h1>
        <h3>Laning is an art form. To boss the early game, these are the main things you should focus on:</h3>
        <h2>Learn your match-ups</h2>
        <h3>This one will take some personal research and experimentation. Every champion has counterpicks, so it's crucial you understand your champion's strengths and weaknesses, and know how to play around both.</h3>
        <h3>One thing to help you in bot lane, where match-ups are more complex in a 2v2, is understanding the rock, paper, scissors rule between poke, sustain and engage. Engage beats sustain, sustain beats poke and poke beats engage.</h3>
        <h3>Healers like Sona and Soraka can heal any poke damage and retaliate with range of their own, but if you’re a Nautilus or Leona, you can engage and kill your opponents from full health before any healing spells come off cooldown. However, poke champions like Lux and Zyra can constantly harass these melee supports and put them to low enough health that it's then too dangerous to engage.</h3>
        <h2>Level 2 and other trading advantages</h2>
        <h3>It's so easy to forget in the heat of the moment, but rather than focussing on mechanically outplaying your opponent, just be smarter.</h3>
        <h3>At the start of the game, hitting Level 2 first is a ginormous advantage. As soon as you hit Level 2, you should look to heavily trade with your opponent, because they can't respond. And it’s similar for Level 3. Keep an eye on your XP bar and walk forward before you hit Level 2, so you can start your lane perfectly.</h3>
        <h3>You can count minions to know when this will happen, too. In top and mid lane, the first wave and one melee minion – so seven minions total – is enough to level up. In the bottom lane, it takes nine minion with the first wave plus three more melee minions from the second wave.</h3>
        <h3>Otherwise, you can easily win a lane battle by not wasting your abilities. If you watch your opponent miss their main form of CC or waste it farming, you can confidently trade, knowing you should have an advantage. And watch for if your opponent is low on mana, because they might just forget.</h3>
